# AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is an AI-based tic-tac-toe game implemented in Python. It allows you to play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The game is played on a 3x3 board, and the objective is to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm
- Interactive command-line interface
- Clear visualization of the game board
- Accurate determination of game results (win, loss, or tie)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py


1. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter the row and column numbers to make your move.

2. Enjoy the game and try to beat the AI opponent!

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid.

3. To make a move, enter the row number (1, 2, or 3) followed by a space and then the column number (1, 2, or 3).

4. The game will display the updated grid after each move.

5. The game ends when one player wins or there is a tie.

## Acknowledgments

1. This game is implemented using the minimax algorithm, which is a classic artificial intelligence algorithm for game playing. It ensures that the AI opponent always makes optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or minimize the chances of losing.
